<h1 class="ui center aligned header">Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3 class="ui center aligned header">Effective Date:  November 22, 2014</h3>

<p>At Reviewable, privacy is a top priority and We are firmly committed to guarding the confidence You have placed in Us and to use, responsibly and professionally, any information You provide. We won’t ask You for personal information unless We feel it is necessary to provide Our Service. We won’t share Your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products and services, or protect our rights, and we will never sell personal information to any third party.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to transactions, activities and data gathered through the service (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;) provided on our website. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to notify You of what information of Yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to You regarding collection, use and distribution of the Information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of Information under Our control; and how You can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy is a legally binding agreement made between You (&ldquo;You,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yourself&rdquo;) and Ideanest LLC, a California Limited Liability Company (&ldquo;Ideanest&rdquo;, &ldquo;We,&rdquo; &ldquo;Us&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our&rdquo;).</p>

<h3>1. Your Information</h3>

<p>In order to operate the Service, and to provide You with information about products or services that may be of interest to You, We may collect (a) &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; (i.e. information that could be used to contact You directly such as full name, payment information, or email address); (b) &ldquo;demographic information&rdquo; (i.e. information that You submit, or that We collect, including, but not limited to, gender, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information); (c) &ldquo;geo-locational data&rdquo; (i.e. information that can be used to identify Your physical location); and (d) &ldquo;meta-data&rdquo; (i.e. information which describes how, when and by whom a particular set of data was collected, and how the data is formatted). Collectively, this information is called &ldquo;Your Information&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You must register with Our Service through your GitHub account as specified in Our Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>2. Information Transfer</h3>

<p>We do not sell or rent Your Information to third parties without Your explicit consent and We only use Your information as described in this Privacy Policy. We view protection of privacy as a critical community principle. We understand clearly that Your information and Your trust is one of Our most important assets. We store and process Your information on computers that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices.</p>

<p>Please note that We use Google Analytics and other analytics tools to help improve our users’ experience. These tools help Us evaluate and monitor use of our website, compile statistical reports on activity on the Service, and improve Our content.</p>

<p>Note that Google Analytics uses both session-based and permanent cookies to collect information about how Our Service performs and how our users use the Service. It may collect more information than We collect. Google stores the information these cookies generate.</p>

<p>We will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users; collect any personal information other than IP addresses; or correlate your IP address with the identity of any user. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and allows the ability to opt out of Google Analytics tracking by visiting their site.</p>

<p>We may share aggregate information that does not identify You personally such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Service. Please note that, while the aggregate data We provide will not identify You personally, in some instances third parties may be able to &ldquo;de-anonymize&rdquo; aggregate data to identify You personally based on additional information they have about You or that they receive from third parties. While We do not intend for third parties to de-anonymize the aggregate data We provide, if You are concerned about potentially being personally identified, You should not use the Service.</p>

<p>In addition, as We continue to develop Our business, We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to applicable data protection laws and the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.  Also, in the unlikely event that We, or substantially all of Our assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

<h3>3. Material You Choose to Reveal</h3>

<p>You may post information, including personal information, on the Service that may be viewed by other users or the public, although We recommend that You do not do so.  We urge You to use good judgment. Do not post any information, including without limitation, personal information, that You do not want other users to know.  Many internet connections are public and/or not secure, and other users using that same connection may have access to Your information; please make sure that You are using a secure internet connection.</p>

<p>YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>

<h3>4. Cookies/Personal Identifiers</h3>

<p>In addition to the information gathered as described above, We may use cookies or similar data storage technologies (&ldquo;personal identifiers&rdquo;) which are necessary to enable Your use of the Service. Note that Google Analytics also uses both session-based and permanent cookies to collect information about how our Service performs and how our users use the Service. If You have given Your consent, We may further use these personal identifiers to track the content You view, and the nature of Your interactions with other users of the Service each time You use the Service, so that We can better serve You when You return to the Service.</p>

<p>Because personal identifiers allow You to take advantage of some of the essential features of the Service, We recommend that You allow access.  For instance, if You block or otherwise reject personal identifiers, You may not be able to use any services that require You to sign in.</p>

<h3>5. Web Beacons</h3>

<p>For our website, a &ldquo;Web beacon,&rdquo; also sometimes called a pixel tag or transparent GIF, is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to You, but allows website operators to check whether You have viewed a particular web page or email communication.  We may place web beacons on our website, and in emails We send to You.</p>

<h3>6. Third Parties’ Use of Web Beacons and Personal Identifiers</h3>

<p>The Service may include links to other websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, may use Web beacons and personal identifiers to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective websites to the Service.</p>

<p>We do not have access to or control over such Web beacons or personal identifiers that these third parties may use.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites.  You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites You visit.</p>

<p>Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information about the opt-out process, You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" class="link">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>

By submitting a DMCA infringement notification, counter notice or other communication, You consent to have this communication forwarded to the person or entity that stored or transmitted the content addressed by Your communications.  For notices other than DMCA infringement notifications and counter notices, You may request that we edit out Your name and contact information.  However, DMCA infringement notifications and counter notices (including any personal information set forth in the notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to us without any deletions.</li>
<li>If required to do so by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or, if We believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Ideanest, You, users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may host discussions or other moderated forums for users who can help each other with technical and general questions. Topics for discussion may include technical support questions and problems, suggestions for improvement, or anything else that relates to the Service. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in this area becomes public information and You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Your personal information.</p>

<h3>8. Ownership of Content</h3>

<p>Our databases automatically update any personal information You edit in Your account, or that You request We edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remains in Our databases. Keep this in mind if You decide to communicate personal information through any of these means.</p>

<p>We do not sell Your Content to third parties. By making Your Content available to Our Service, You are granting Us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, host, display, store, cache, reproduce, publish, transmit, modify, re-format, re-arrange, distribute, and adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Service is available), and create derivative works of Your Content. The rights You grant to Us are for the limited purpose of operating and providing the Service, improving the Service, and allowing Us to develop new services. The reference in this license to "derivative works" is not intended to give Us a right to make substantive changes or derivations to Your Content, but does enable other users to redistribute Your Content by means of their own accounts in a manner that allows users to, for example, add captions, text, commentary, filters, photo-editing, or other Content in connection with Your Content.</p>

<h3>9. Information Retention</h3>

<p>To preserve the integrity of Our databases, Our standard procedures call for Us to retain information submitted by users for an indefinite length of time. We understand Your submissions as consent to store all Your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if We so wish. If required by law, We will nullify user information by erasing it from Our database. We will also respond to written user requests to nullify account information.</p>

<h3>10. Choice/Opt-Out</h3>

<p>We also give users the option to remove their information from Our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive Our service, all via written request to Us.</p>

<h3>11. Special Cases in Which We Share Personal Information</h3>

<p>We may disclose personal information when We determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Our company or other visitors to the Service. We also may disclose Your personal information to Our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom We are under common control. Whenever personal information is disclosed under this paragraph, We may also disclose Your demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of Our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.</p>

<h3>12. Our Security Precautions</h3>

<p>Your profile is password-protected so that only You have access to Your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give Your password to anyone. Our staff will never proactively reach out to You and ask for any personal account information, including Your password.  You should never share devices. This will help protect Your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.</p>

<p>Your payment or banking information, including credit card information, will be stored by a third party, which is PCI compliant and exceeds industry standards for financial security. Mailing, storage, back-up and other third party services utilized by Us will also meet or exceed applicable industry standards for security.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, We cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit, and You do so at Your own risk. If You have any further questions on this issue, please refer to Our
<a href="/terms" class="link">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>13. European Union Users</h3>

<p>Our business is located primarily in the United States. If You provide information to Us, the information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) to the United States. By providing personal information to Us, You are consenting to its storage and use as described herein.</p>

<h3>14. Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</h3>

<p>If at any point We decide to use particular personal information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, We will notify users by way of an email and Your continued use of the Service will constitute Your acceptance of the new use terms. We also encourage You to review this Privacy Policy periodically. By using the Service, You do hereby represent and warrant that You have read, understand and agree to all terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
